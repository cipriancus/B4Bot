# Modul1


Note: Before you can compile the bot, there will be problems with dependencies that you will solve with pip, there will be dependencies for nltk, tagger and words, and a few more, they can be tricked by inserting nltk.download ( ) that opens a window to select dependencies is not hard to find and install.

# Modul 3

There must be Stanford NLP installed in D:\Stanford, in main.py of Module 3 you can see thi

os.environ["JAVAHOME"] = "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_111"
os.environ["STANFORD_PARSER"] = "D:\Stanford\stanford-parser-full-2015-12-09"
os.environ["STANFORD_MODELS"] = "D:\Stanford\stanford-parser-full-2015-12-09"

Stanford link : http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-parser-full-2015-12-09.zip

To execute, enter cmd into that folder and run python main.py

Other components are required to install with pip when they appear as errors, it's easy and intuitive
